# ruby_merge_sort

This is an implementation of a merge sort sorting algorithm written in ruby. Merge sort clocks in at O(n log n) due to its divide and conquer paradigm. This type of sort works by dividing the original array into two arrays, which it then combines after having sorted them by also splitting those arrays, and those arrays, until it finds collections of single items, which it compares and combines, and then climbs back up the latter recombining. If that sounds like recursion, well, it is!
